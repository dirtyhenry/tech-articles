# My Technical Articles

Hi, I'm Mick. I'm a developer from Paris. This is the home to my professional
and hobbyist software engineering adventures.

I sometimes share it with [zertyuio](https://github.com/zertyuio), who was my
associate when we ran a company together, from 2014 to 2017.

This repository contains [mickf.net/tech][1]'s code.

It is about side-projects, iOS, Rails, JS, and whatever technical subject you
can meet when you're a developer.
