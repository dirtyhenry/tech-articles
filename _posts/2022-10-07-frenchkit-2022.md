## 🌟 The talks I recommend

### any Idea How to Use some Generics? — Antoine van der Lee

Dive into the difference between `some` vs `any` and how they can replace older
forms of expressing constraints on generics.

Note the choice of case in the title. 🤣

### Building Custom Property Wrappers for SwiftUI (and how to test them) — Donny Wals

Implements
[a fetching data property wrapper for SwiftUI](https://github.com/donnywals/SwiftUIPropertyWrapperTalk).

Donny is quite interesting because, year after year, he focuses on predicting
what Apple plans for the future as opposed to investing in 3rd-party libraries
or frameworks.

For instance, he seems genuinely convinced that, for Apple people, data fetchers
belong to views — following Apple’s own APIs — and that Combine and Core Data
are just as relevant in 2022 as they always were.

### Masterclass: Hacking iOS Apps - and trying to prevent it — Elliot Schrock

This talk provided a lot of valuable insights. Using a jailbroken iPhone, Elliot
went backwards from the demo to the theory of hacking, highlighting how to
control the app from the CLI. Elliot also mentioned this funny analogy about
security:

> 🏃 🐻 If you’re being chased by a bear, you must run faster than the slowest
> guy.

Tools mentioned:

- [`cycript`](http://www.cycript.org) (pronounced ssssscript apparently);
- [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com) (disassembler);
- [Clutch](https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch) (executable dumper);
- [ipainstaller](https://wiki.smhuda.com/pentesting/tool-usage/ipainstaller).

### Swift Quiz — Vincent Pradeilles

Three questions:

1. ✅ Retaining cycles. I got this one right.
2. ❌ Mutating function on a `struct` with a `let` property. You can reassign
   `self`. I got it wrong.
3. ❌ Empty enums. Does the Swift compiler accept a function that has a
   signature that returns something but actually has an empty body, when the
   argument is an empty enum (which cannot be instantiated)? It does. I got it
   wrong too. But it explains why the signature of `fatalError` is `Never`.

## 🔥 Hot Takes

**I am so bad at socializing during conferences.** My interactions with other
human beings at FrenchKit consisted primarily of asking questions during Q&A
sessions, but it was hard for me to go beyond that. I tried to attend an event
on the Thursday evening. But a bar packed with 200 people, 95% of which are
nerdy dorks like myself — now quite younger — is not an environment I can thrive
in. I am taller and deafer than the average person so that would translate into
me bending over groups of people, pretending I can hear what is being said. Not
quite fun.

**Next time, I will try to attend NSSpain.** It was the last edition of
FrenchKit per say. The hosts are willing to expand to other technologies — which
will be appreciated after the dot conferences disappeared after
[being bought by Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.dotconferences.com/blog/dotconferences-joins-wttj).

**I will build next features at work for iOS 14 users.** Today, we support
iOS 12. Looking at iosref’s
[iOS version by device table](https://iosref.com/ios), I realized that bumping
straight to iOS 14 will leave aside some devices stuck with iOS 12. But no
device is stuck with iOS 13 — or iOS 14 for that matter. So, at the end of the
day, iOS 14 sounds like a sweet spot to be able to benefit both from async/await
and a decent version of SwiftUI.

**I should give things a second chance.** I'm talking about you jailbreaking
phones — to put myself in hackers shoes — and UI testing.

## 🪣 The rest of my notes

Here I share raw notes from the other talks cause… why not?

### Beyond Code: Skills for Impactful Development That Makes a Difference — Maxim Cramer

How to make impact beyond code? Mostly about communication. 🦒 The image of the
giraffe in a park that every can sort of picture vs feature descriptions. We
share very little of our knowledge when we communicate. Shocking fact: 2% of
funding is for female founders.

### I 💕 Swift Concurrency — Tunde Adegoroye

Concurrency, `async let`, tasks and tasks groups, actors.

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/HptV7UUTToQ)

### How not to develop an “Umm” detector using Create ML — Yono Mittlefehldt

Um detector. Not really about code but about the thought process. Some tools
mentioned worth bookmarking:

- sox CLI ([https://sox.sourceforge.net](https://sox.sourceforge.net))
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Machine Learning - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/)

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/45hxH7-p5IM)

### Documenting your project with DocC — Simon Støvring

Wrap up around DocC by the author of the
[Runestone](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893?l=en)
text editor.

I started using DocC with my
[Blocks](https://dirtyhenry.github.io/blocks/documentation/blocks/) project, but
I didn’t know about
[tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc/tutorials) with DocC.

### SwiftUI at Scale — Thomas Ricouard

The point was that SwiftUI is production ready. And apparently, it’s tied to the
iOS version running the phone so it doesn’t make sense to use SwiftUI before
iOS 14. I guess this means that SwiftUI in iOS 13 is broken.

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/tsZBLvdcoTw)

### SwiftUI Navigation — Luis Ascorbe

Should we use SwiftUI or UIKit for navigation? It depends. He recommended the
following:

- NavigationStack.
- [Brandon Williams: SwiftUI Navigation & URL Routing](https://vimeo.com/751580644).
- Taking a look at
  [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)
  aka _TCA_ which sounds like a good idea.
- [Composable Architecture at Scale](https://vimeo.com/751173570) by Krzysztof
  Zablocki

### From source code to executable: a day in the life of a Build System — Samuel Giddinis

Why do we need build systems and the complexity behind them. Some notes:

- [Swiftlint has a Makefile](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/main/Makefile);
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build) is great for large monorepos but require a
  significant investment and care

![My Code's Compiling](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png)

### Migrating your legacy code to local SPM packages — Zouhair Mahieddine

This title describes exactly the content of the talk. 😆

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/bXCuVzsdyDo)

### Testing for Accessibility — Robin Kanatzar

A reminder that the accessibility tool is good. Robin recommended the following
tool:

- [Mobile Flow Analyzer - Evinced, Inc.](https://www.evinced.com/products/flow-analyzer-for-mobile)

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/59uLAKVB-d4)

### Cloud Functions to the rescue — Zamzam Farzamipooya

The talk focuses on Firebase/Google. That’s kind of a non starter for my tastes.

It reminded me of stuff I did for Flâneur and why I didn’t like Firebase: data
access boundaries are fragile and require significant effort.

— [📺 Watch](https://youtu.be/DdGfFkOz9gQ)

### From App to Game Development — Michel-André Chirita

Interesting. The game is:
[Versus Arena](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/versus-arena/id1542795843?l=en)

It made me want to develop a Backgammon game again.

### The journey of Widgets begins with one step — Audrey Sobgou-Zebaze

How to start implementing widgets with
[WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/widgets/).
