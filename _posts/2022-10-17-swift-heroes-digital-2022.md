Just as [I did last year][i1], here are my notes from the talks from [Swift
Heroes][sh] that I have watched from home.

Talks with 🌟 are the talks I recommend the most.

## A Crash Course of async/await (Swift Concurrency) - [Shai Mishali][1] 🌟

Shai offered a large overview of how concurrency has been managed over time by
Swift, from using [`DispatchGroup`][2]:

```swift
func doSomething() {
  let group = DispatchGroup()

  group.enter()
  doAsync { result in
    defer { group.leave() }
  }

  group.notify(queue: .main) {
    print("Done")
  }
}
```

to the [async/await introduced in Swift 5.5][3], made available to iOS 13.0+ and
macOS 10.15+:

```swift
func doSomething() async throws -> UIImage {
  let result = try await doAsync()
}
```

or

```swift
func doSomething() {
  Task { // or Task.detached
    do {
      let result = try await doAsync()
    } catch {
      // handle error
    }
  }
}
```

The main benefits of this evolution are:

- It brings the performance of async code with the readability of sync code;
- You can use async/await not only with functions but also with _async getters_;
- It deals well with error management and task cancellation;
- You can synchronise many _tasks_ via _tasks groups_;
- Async sequences makes it easy to loop over data fetched asynchronoulsy;
- `@MainActor` helps guaranteeing that code will run on the main thread.

If you want to create your own `async` functions, you can use one of:

- `withCheckedContinuation`
- `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`
- `withUnsafeContinuation`
- `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation`

If you want to create your own _async sequences_, using `AsyncStream` was
recommended.

I will for sure give WWDC’s [_Protect mutable state with Swift actors_][4] a
rewatch.

## TextKit 2 Is About to Make Text Easier - [Marcin Krzyżanowski][5]

Marcin built upon [his talk from last year][i1] to give a live coding demo of
the TextKit 2 framework that was [announced at WWDC 21][6] and helped him make
his life easier while working on his [Swift Studio][7] project that is still
ongoing.

He wrote [`STTextView`][8], as an attempt to code a `NSTextView` replacement
component utilizing TextKit 2.

## Modern Collection Views by Example - [Gaetano Matonti][9]

I haven't used table or collection views in a while and for sure they changed
quite a bit. Gaetano walks through all recent modifications, showcasing how
Apple has used the framework to build their own iOS apps, such as **App Store**
or **Music**.

Also bookmarked: [_Advances in UI Data Sources_][10] from WWDC’ 19.

## The Ever Increasing Convergence of Native iOS and Android Mobile Development - [John O'Reilly][11]

Kotlin and Swift grew similar and seem to be ever-converging. John made the case
that, if UI should be coded in the primary language for each platform, [Kotlin
Multiplatform Mobile][12] could be a framework of choice to package the common
engine parts of an app. Definitely worth trying or giving a look.

## Swift Mobile DevOps - [Atanas Chanev][13]

Atanas offered a good reminder that Swift can be used to write scripts in the
terminal, and an overivew of the features of [Bitrise][14].

## Tell Me Quando - Implementing Feature Flags - [Jorge D. Ortiz Fuentes][15]

Great live-coding talk on practical tips to embed feature flags within an iOS
app. Funnily enough, many people asked him about his tooling for live coding. It
is called [lazycoder][16] and it is based on [espanso][17], a text expander that
I have been using quite intensively in the recent past and strongly recommend.

## Building Swift Packages in VScode - [Tim Condon][x]

TO COMPLETE. I AM HERE!

## Property Wrappers to the Rescue! - [Davide Repetto][x]

TO COMPLETE

## Remove Your Xcode Workspace From Git - [Firas Safa][x]

## Improving Developer Experience Through Tools and Techniques - [Krzysztof Zabłocki][x]

Krzysztof is making the case that any opportunity to accelerate a process, or
automate steps, or any architecture decision that can help saving time can be
have a tremendous impact on a team when you do the maths.

Jonathan Lefèvre would love this.

Krzysztof did help the NYTimes to rewrite their iOS app.

## Bluetooth + Swift: It's a Match! - Samuele Perricone, Alessia Botta, Pietro Santececca

Bluetooth: mouais. Le mec hyper émotif. Quelques idées sur les tests
"impossible" Source d'inspiration pour faire une app de webcam ?

## 🍏 + 🔥 = ❤️ (Firebase for Apple developers) - Peter Friese, Charlotte Liang

Firebase. Mouais. Firebase c'est super pour commencer vite. Mais ça rend trop de
service. C'est un peu un lock-in au final.

## Secondary Skills as a Developer - Jeroen Leenarts, Amos Gyamfi

## UI/UX Basics for iOS Developers - Jane Bondar

[NIX](https://www.nixsolutions.com/services/mobile-development-services/)
Ukraine: i like how emotions could be felt during the conference.

Doherty threshold <- joke

The 44pt rule: out of Apple's documentation.

## Obscure Swift - Non Obvious Aspects of Swift and Magic Behind Them - [Paweł Łopusiński][x] (https://twitter.com/Losiowaty)

SIL : Swift Intermediary Laguage ou truc du genre I'm not fmailiar how Swift
related to C++, C, Objective-C, etc.

## Refactoring ReSwift Applications in Order to Make Them Modular - [Giovanni Catania][x]

https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture

I feel sick of Redux though I'd like to have a change to take a look at
PointFree.

## Embrace the Evolution of a Product, Mindset and Tools for a Domain/Test Driven Development Approach - Alessandro Chiarotto, Aleksandar Gotev
