## tl;dr

As a programmer, I create eco-conscious software with user-friendly design,
embracing IndieWeb principles. I'm cautious with big corporations, upholding
ethics and user rights. My goal is to produce durable and sustainable code,
prioritizing maintainability and developer well-being. I respond swiftly to
evolving challenges for impactful work in a changing tech landscape.

## A longer version

Let me explain. There is a sense of uneasiness with the state of the world these
days. After having the privilege to spend a fun and peaceful holiday season, I
wanted to do a headcheck on where I stand with my role as a programmer and if I
am aligned with my aspirations and values. So I decided to write my mission
statement. I will develop each of its components with an example of how I think
I apply it.

### üåç Climate Friendliness

I need to consider all environmental impacts of the code I write: the hardware
it runs on, the energy it requires, its purpose for the people running it.

Example. I work for [Memo¬†Bank][18], a bank for small and medium-sized
companies, that [prioritizes in a no bull-shit way][1] the transition to a low
carbon economy. It has been recognised as such by [Reclaim Finance][2], and is
one of the recommended banks on their website [Change de banque][3].

### ü§ù Human Friendliness

I prioritise security and user experience, in that order, to promote the
well-being of end-users. It involves creating software that is intuitive,
inclusive, and positively impacts users' lives.

Example. I feel that it was my main motivations to start running the [Statium
Newsletter][4], a minimalistic soccer newsletter written in French that focuses
solely on the game. It filters out the noise from meaningless controversies,
[poor journalistic practices][5], invasive advertisement and poor user
experience of alternative sources. As of today, [statium.app][6] has a perfect
score of 100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO with
Lighthouse.

### ‚ö° Mastery

I want to continuously get better at my craft. Software is never "done". A
skillset is never complete. I want to keep engaging on how to be a better
programmer, a better team member, and a better person.

Example. I think a good practice of mastery is balancing being very curious with
just what it needs of focus. I wrote about [why side-projects are so important
to me][7] in the past: my curiosity is satisfied and the new things I learn have
many positive impacts on my job at Memo¬†Bank.

### üåê IndieWeb Friendliness

I support decentralised and people-focused technologies and products that help
individuals to have greater control over their online presence and their data.

Example. I use RSS daily, I [POSSE][8], I run a newsletter using
[Buttondown][9], my microblogging platform of choice is [micro.blog][10], I
favor community-run or independant sources when I use links in my blog posts
(examples: [TMDB][11], [Discogs][12], [Sports Reference][13], etc.). I make [my
default apps][14] public.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Big Corporation Cautiousness

I am curious of the ethical considerations of big companies when engaging with
their products and technologies. I avoid those that compromise user privacy or
promote monopolistic behavior.

Example. I stopped using Gmail, I don't actively use Meta products or X. I am
wary of AI products and try to use them as sparingly and ethically as possible.

### üå± Durability & Sustainability

I focus on the longevity and sustainability of the software I write. I want my
code to run for a long time, I want my mind and body to remain healthy for as
long as possible, and I want my online presence to live long.

Example. I pick dependencies to rely on very carefully and sparingly, I express
[gratitude towards Open-Source developers][15], I avoid and fix
[dead-links][16], I maintain [a good work-life balance][17].

## Conclusion

This mission statement serves as a guiding compass in my journey as a
programmer, reminding me of the values and principles I hold dear. It is a
commitment to creating software that not only meets the needs of the present but
also contributes positively to the future.
